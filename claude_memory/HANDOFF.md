# HANDOFF — preparation-first tuning research (read this first)

You are continuing a research project toward a **VLDB method paper**. Read this file fully,
then [`exp_notes/similar_workload.md`](../exp_notes/similar_workload.md) (the findings
document, F1–F7b), then skim `CLAUDE.md` for repo mechanics. Everything below is backed by
completed experiments on the Miyabi-C cluster; paths are relative to the repo root
`/work/xg26g002/x10563/DBTune`.

## 1. Thesis

**Useful tuning must be reliable and one- or few-shot.** A tuner is only valuable at the
moments that matter — launch day, a sudden traffic surge — and at those moments you need a
good configuration in **minutes**, with a **deterministic** outcome. Anything that needs an
hour of exploration with a luck-dependent result is not usable in production.

## 2. The problem with automatic tuning (measured, not asserted)

Evidence from our 1-hour-deadline comparison (4+1 arms × 3 seeds, hard `timeout 3600`,
histories `scripts/DBTune_history/history_eval2_<arm>_s<seed>.json`, per-iteration
wall-clock in each row's `update_time`; summary table in exp_notes §"transfer-method
comparison"):

- **Slow:** one config evaluation ≈ 5–6 min (restart + benchmark) → ~10 evaluations/hour,
  identical across all methods; optimizer overhead is negligible (2–17 s/iter). Speed is
  physics, not algorithm.
- **High variance:** best-after-60-min by seed — cold SMAC 3183/5146/1568; OtterTune
  1933/13716/3096; RGPE 1925/4266/3547; even OpAdviser-without-replay 6700/21640/6800.
  The seed, not the method, decides the outcome.
- **Transfer via surrogates converts nothing:** OtterTune mapping and RGPE were
  indistinguishable from cold start, even with a 15-source repository containing data from
  the *identical* workload (F4, F7). Root cause: EI's candidate generation never proposes
  the source's known-good configs, so surrogate knowledge never gets evaluated.
- **The only mechanism that worked is evaluating source-best configs directly:** OpAdviser
  scored 19,344 mean (19.1–19.5k on *every* seed, reached by ~minute 35, 97% of optimum) —
  and we proved via paper+code audit (F7a; commit `8ca5a99`) that this comes from an
  **undocumented** replay init in its released code, not the published space-construction
  method (space-only ablation F7b: median 6.8k).

## 3. Our approach: preparation-first tuning

Since tuning is too slow/random to run when needed, run it **before** it's needed:

1. **Phase 1 — design testing workloads.** From rough knowledge of the expected production
   workload, choose the *minimal* set of imitation workloads. Feasible because
   transferability is anisotropic (see §4: configs survive concurrency/mix/skew errors,
   die on data-scale errors) — cover only the dimensions that break transfer.
2. **Phase 2 — collect good configs fast on staging.** Offline, safe (crashes free,
   datadir refreshable — production is NOT: poisoned state/durability-off configs are
   real risks there). Avoid predicted-failure configs and redundant configs; target a
   small diverse top-k portfolio, not surrogate accuracy. BO (LlamaTune) collection
   produces the most mismatch-robust configs; ~100 successes ≈ half a node-day suffice.
3. **Phase 3 — one-shot apply, then safe probing.** At deployment/surge: retrieve + apply
   the best prepared config (one restart, minutes, deterministic — the surge case is
   backed by S1: configs collected at 32 clients hold at 128, 20,180 tps). Then refine on
   the live system under a hard no-big-degradation constraint (probe near validated
   configs, instant rollback).

These three phases are the paper's three technical challenges (user's framing — keep it):
(a) fewest testing workloads that still enable one-shot tuning; (b) fastest collection
without failed/redundant samples; (c) production-safe probing after the one-shot.
Positioning: challenge (a) is the novel core; (b) extends LlamaTune-style collection;
(c) must be carefully differentiated from OnlineTune (VLDB'22) / SafeOpt.

## 4. Completed experiments (what, where, result)

All findings with full tables: `exp_notes/similar_workload.md` (F1–F7b). Raw evidence:
`scripts/DBTune_history/history_*.json` (every row has config, metrics, trial_state,
`update_time`). Operational docs: `claude_memory/COLLECTION.md`, `KNOB_CURATION.md`,
`MIYABI.md` (cluster gotchas).

1. **Knob space**: `scripts/experiment/gen_knobs/mysql_perf_8.0.json` — 117 perf-relevant
   MySQL 8.0 knobs curated from 186 (`scripts/curate_knob_file.py`; drops only
   workload-independent breakers/observability/semantics/capacity knobs).
2. **Source collection, S0–S4 × {sweep,lhs,random,llama}** (sweep S0/S1 only):
   target = sysbench oltp_read_write, 150 tables × 800k rows, 128 clients, zipf 0.7.
   Mismatch ladder: S0 identical, S1 32 clients, S2 uniform skew, S3 80k rows (÷10),
   S4 read-heavier mix. Configs `scripts/config_collect_S*_*.ini`; runners
   `scripts/lab/collect_launch.sh` (round 1) and `collect2_*` (round 2, chunked).
   Task-id convention: `miyabic_150-<rows>-<threads>-oltp_read_write[<variant>]-<zipf>-<strategy>`.
3. **Transplant evaluation** (= copy a source's top-3 configs to the target, 1 eval each;
   `scripts/lab/eval_replay_batch.sh`, results `history_eval_replay_*.json`):
   headline matrix in exp_notes. Key: S1/S4 transfer ~losslessly (91–101%), S2 moderate,
   S3 space-filling collapses (51–55%) but S3-llama keeps 88%; sweep useless (4%);
   **winner's curse + rank inversion** → the source's #1 config is often not the best
   transplant → always copy top-k (F3).
4. **Warm-start BO eval** (10 iters, 3 seeds, per-cell pools): warm ≈ cold, seed dominates
   (F4). Pools built by `scripts/build_eval_pools.py` (SUCCESS-only; FAILED rows carry
   penalty objectives + empty metrics and must never enter pools).
5. **1-h deadline shootout + ablations** (§2 above; scripts `scripts/lab/transfer_*`,
   arms ottertune/rgpe/opadviser/opadviser_ns/cold; `space_transfer_replay=False` ini key
   disables OpAdviser's replay init). Chart artifact exists (TPS-over-time per seed).
6. **Collection yield / failure mechanics** (exp_notes §"Collection yield"): round 1 fixed
   451 attempts, one datadir per wave → 8–30% success, failures come in long streaks from
   **sticky datadir state** (huge redo logs → >600 s recovery on every restart), NOT from
   the configs; round 2 (stop at 100 successes + fresh datadir every 4 h chunk,
   `collect2_node_run.sh`) → 44–99% success. LlamaTune improved most because in round 1
   the streaks fed false FAILED labels into its inner BO (fixed-schedule lhs/random only
   lost samples). **Round-1 llama cells (S0/S1) understate LlamaTune; don't cite S1-llama
   (38 samples, 61%) against BO collection.**

## 5. State & next steps (as of 2026-07-09)

Done: everything above. Agreed direction: **method paper (not E&A)** around the three
challenges. Immediate next candidates (user has NOT yet green-lit specific ones):
- **S3 config-repair test** (~10 evals): rescale working-set knobs of S3's top configs by
  the data-size ratio, re-transplant; tests the "repair" idea (currently a hypothesis,
  deliberately excluded from the user's three-challenge framing — ask before elevating it).
- **Related-work novelty check**: a ready-to-run adversarial prompt was written for an
  external agent (5 claims incl. self-driving-DBMS "envisioned vs built" distinction).
- Hardening for the paper: more seeds + repeated transplants (error bars), continuous
  dissimilarity axis, second/third target, PostgreSQL, realistic production-side workload
  (oltpbench TPC-C), surge demo (load quadruples → prepared config applied in ~3 min vs
  tuners still searching), 3-h horizon run.

## 6. Operational gotchas (will bite you)

- PBS on Miyabi: `qstat <finished-job>` prints "No unfinished job found" but **exits 0** —
  grep the message, don't trust the exit code. `pbsdsh` strips env vars — workload
  settings must travel in ini keys (`sysbench_zipfian_exp`, `sysbench_rand_type`,
  `sysbench_extra_args`), never exports. Budget: `show_token` (was topped up to 5,760
  node-h; check before big waves).
- Snapshots: `mysql_build/data_150x800k` (57 GB) and `data_150x80k`; every run copies one
  to a per-task Lustre dir (~2 min). Node-local /tmp is too small (14 GB).
- Histories under `scripts/DBTune_history/` are append-only state for resume — collection
  runners never delete them; eval2 (timed) runs DO delete their own at start.
- Single measurements are noisy (~2× on default config; 19940→9605 on re-run) — never
  trust top-1, never compare single numbers.
- Combined source repo for selection experiments: `scripts/DBTune_history/pool_ALL/`
  (15 contexts, 1,517 SUCCESS rows, sweep excluded, `_history_cache.pkl` prebuilt).
- `min_success` ini key = stop collection at N successes; `sweep_levels`, `replay_file`
  (Sampler replay mode), `llamatune_*` keys — all documented in CLAUDE.md optimizer table.
